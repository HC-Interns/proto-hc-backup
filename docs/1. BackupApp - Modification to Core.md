# 1. ADR - BackupApp - Modification to Core

Date: 2018-07-019

## Status

Executed - Need Security Testing - Need Approval

## Context

We need to back up the chain.db file the way it is saved it is saved locally.
For this we need some info exposed from validateCommit() and the query API

## Decision

**Chang to validateCommit() :**
- For the validateCommit(), The header that is passe back only contains the EntryLink, EntyType and Time.
- We it retuns the Entire Header including the the HeaderLink, TypeLinks and Signature too

**Change to query Function**
- Now the query will not try to return the %dna
- So if you execute a query without any Constrains it will get you all the entry_types and %agent

## Consequences

Helps you backup everything that is required in the chain.db
